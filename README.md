# function-and-library-in-python
--------------------------------
1. function

>   function in python different with formula we usually use like addition, substarction,multiplication, and ect. function in python use to simplify formula written so we only need to write it once then we just need to call its name to use it again. these feature make coding program more simple and not repetitif. function in python divided in 2 type such as 
- def is a keyword that define function in python. so, def use for make a function different with write formula manual. with def feature we can make formula in the beginning and call it with name of the function with its parameter inside parentheses beside function name
- lambda function is just like any normal python function, except that it has no name when defining it, and it is contained in one line of code
2. class

>   In Python, classes are defined using the class keyword. Class is made to represent a certain object, so it will be assist in the process of solving complex problems by State the physical characteristics of a problem. Classes in Python The default has a public Access Specifier.
>   Inside the class there are class variables. A class variable is a variable that shared or shared by all instances (children) of the class. class variable defined inside the class, but outside the methods in the class the.
>   Then there is the object. Object is an instance or embodiment of a class. If class is the prototype, and object is the finished product.
3. library

>   library is a reusable chunk of code that you may want to include in your programs/ projects. library actually is a module that create by other people to simplify code program. library that often use is:
- os

>The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
- io

>The io module provides Python's main facilities for dealing with various types of input or output
- math

>The math module in python provides function to do math calculation such as rounding
- sys

>The sys module in python provides function to interacting with system
